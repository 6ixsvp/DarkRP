## Code to adjust movement speed in jobs:

-- Define the job
TEAM_EXAMPLE = DarkRP.createJob("Example Job", {
    color = Color(255, 0, 0, 255),  -- Set the job color (just an example)
    model = {"models/props_c17/oildrum001.mdl"},  -- Example model
    description = "This is an example job with custom movement speed.",  -- Job description
    weapons = {"weapon_pistol"},  -- Weapons this job can have
    command = "examplejob",  -- Command to spawn as this job
    max = 2,  -- Max number of players
    salary = 50,  -- Salary for the job
    admin = 0,  -- Admin level required (0 means anyone can take it)
    vote = false,  -- If a vote is required to take the job
    -- Add the movement speed adjustments here
    walkSpeed = 250,  -- Normal walk speed is around 200, so 250 is a bit faster
    runSpeed = 400,  -- Normal run speed is around 500, so 400 is slightly slower than normal
    -- Custom job model, description, etc.
})

-- Optional: If you want to dynamically change the speed based on a player's team
hook.Add("PlayerSpawn", "SetMovementSpeed", function(ply)
    if ply:Team() == TEAM_EXAMPLE then  -- Check if the player is the "Example Job"
        ply:SetWalkSpeed(250)  -- Set the custom walk speed
        ply:SetRunSpeed(400)  -- Set the custom run speed
    end
end)

-- NOTES THAT EXPLAIN

Explanation:

    Job Creation:
    The DarkRP.createJob function defines a new job with various attributes like color, model, weapons, and salary. Inside this definition, you can directly modify the movement speed for walking (walkSpeed) and running (runSpeed).

    Movement Speed:
        walkSpeed = 250: This makes the walking speed 250 (normal is around 200, so it's a bit faster).
        runSpeed = 400: This makes the running speed 400 (normal is around 500, so it's slightly slower but still fast).

    Optional Hook for Dynamic Speed Change:
    The hook.Add("PlayerSpawn", "SetMovementSpeed", function(ply) listens for when a player spawns. If the player is on the specified team (in this case, TEAM_EXAMPLE), it adjusts their walking and running speeds dynamically. You can modify this hook to apply the movement speed to other jobs as well by adding conditions for different teams.

Where to add it:

    You should add the movement speed properties (walkSpeed and runSpeed) directly inside the DarkRP.createJob function in your jobs file for each job that requires custom movement speeds.
    The hook.Add("PlayerSpawn", "SetMovementSpeed", function(ply) can be placed at the bottom of your job definition to handle dynamic movement speed adjustments whenever a player spawns.

This setup ensures that the players with this job will have the desired movement speeds without affecting the rest of the game.
